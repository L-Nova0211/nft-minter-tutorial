# 📝 NFT Minter Tutorial Files

This repository contains the starter files (`minter-starter-files`) and completed version (`nft-tutorial`) of Alchemy's [NFT Minter tutorial](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter). 

## ℹ️ About the tutorial

In this beginner-level tutorial, we'll teach you how to connect your smart contract to your React dApp project by building an NFT Minter using Metamask and Web3. 

## 🤔 Note

Neither the `minter-starter-files` or `nft-tutorial` have their `node_modules` folder. Before running `npm start` in your terminal to start the React project, run `npm install` to download all the package dependencies.
